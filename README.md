# zewif-zcashd

A Rust crate that reads a `zcashd` `wallet.dat` file and converts its contents
into the **Zcash Wallet Interchange Format (ZeWIF)**.

## What is ZeWIF?

ZeWIF is a wallet-agnostic representation of Zcash wallet data — seeds, keys,
addresses, accounts, and transaction history — designed so that users can move
between Zcash wallets without losing data. Each wallet implementation provides
an importer/exporter that translates its native format to and from ZeWIF; once
data is in ZeWIF, any other ZeWIF-aware wallet can consume it.

The format itself is defined by the [`zewif`](https://crates.io/crates/zewif)
crate, which this crate depends on. This crate is the `zcashd`-side translator:
it knows how to take a legacy `zcashd` Berkeley DB wallet and produce the
generic ZeWIF representation.

## What this crate does

`zcashd` stores wallets as Berkeley DB files containing a heterogeneous mix of
serialized records (HD seeds, transparent keys, sapling keys, unified
accounts, transactions, witnesses, metadata, etc.). Migrating that data
faithfully requires:

1. **Reading the BDB file.** Done by shelling out to `db_dump` to produce a
   key/value listing. A copy of Berkeley DB 6.2.32 is vendored in `vendor/`
   and built by `build.rs`, so the crate is self-contained and does not
   require a system-installed BDB. A user-supplied `db_dump` binary can also
   be passed explicitly via `BDBDump::from_file_with_path`.
2. **Parsing the records.** The raw bytes are decoded into typed `zcashd`
   wallet structures using the same serialization that `zcashd` itself uses.
   To stay byte-compatible with `zcashd 0.6.2`, the `zcash_*` and `sapling`
   dependency versions are pinned to match — they should not be bumped
   independently.
3. **Migrating to ZeWIF.** The parsed `ZcashdWallet` is walked and
   re-projected into the generic ZeWIF model: accounts, addresses (transparent,
   sapling, unified), transactions, witnesses, and seed material.

## Usage

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use zewif::BlockHeight;
use zewif_zcashd::{BDBDump, ZcashdDump, ZcashdParser, migrate_to_zewif};

let bdb = BDBDump::from_file(Path::new("wallet.dat"))?;
let dump = ZcashdDump::from_bdb_dump(&bdb, /* strict = */ true)?;
let (wallet, _unparsed) = ZcashdParser::parse_dump(&dump)?;

let export_height = BlockHeight::from_u32(2_400_000);
let zewif = migrate_to_zewif(&wallet, export_height)?;
```

## Layout

- `src/bdb_dump.rs` — invokes `db_dump` and collects its key/value output.
- `build.rs` + `vendor/db-6.2.32.tar.gz` — vendors and builds Berkeley DB so
  `db_dump` is available at compile time.
- `src/zcashd_dump.rs`, `src/zcashd_parser.rs`, `src/zcashd_wallet/`,
  `src/parser/` — decode the BDB records into typed `zcashd` wallet structs.
- `src/migrate/` — converts a parsed `ZcashdWallet` into a `Zewif` value.
- `docs/KeyPreservation.md` — what cryptographic material is preserved during
  migration and why.
- `docs/TransactionAssignment.md` — how transactions are assigned to accounts
  in the migrated wallet.

## Status

This is a one-way migration tool: `zcashd` → ZeWIF. It is intended for users
moving off `zcashd` (which is being deprecated) into ZeWIF-aware wallets.

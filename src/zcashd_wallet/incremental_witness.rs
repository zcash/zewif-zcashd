use crate::{parse, parser::prelude::*};

/// An authentication path generator for a specific note in a Merkle tree.
///
/// `IncrementalWitness` creates and maintains the cryptographic evidence needed to prove
/// that a specific note commitment exists in the blockchain's commitment tree. It can be
/// efficiently updated as new notes are added to the tree, without requiring a complete
/// tree rebuild.
///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// In Zcash's shielded protocols, witnesses serve several critical functions:
///
/// - **Spending Notes**: When spending a shielded note, the witness proves the note exists
///   in the blockchain's commitment tree without revealing which specific note is being spent
///
/// - **Authentication Paths**: A witness contains the minimum set of hash values needed to
///   verify that a specific leaf (note commitment) is part of a tree with a known root (anchor)
///
/// - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: The witness data is used within zk-SNARKs to validate
///   transactions without revealing private information
///
/// Each shielded protocol has a different Merkle tree depth:
/// - Sprout: 29 levels deep, using SHA-256 compression
/// - Sapling: 32 levels deep, using Pedersen hashes
/// - Orchard: 32 levels deep, using Poseidon hashes
///
/// # Data Preservation
/// During wallet migration, maintaining complete witness data is absolutely critical:
///
/// - **Unspent Notes**: Without valid witnesses, unspent notes cannot be spent after migration
/// - **Path Components**: The authentication path for each note must be preserved exactly
/// - **Tree State**: The current state of the tree at the time of the witness creation
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// * `DEPTH` - The depth of the Merkle tree (29 for Sprout, 32 for Sapling/Orchard)
/// * `Hash` - The hash type used for tree nodes (varies by protocol)
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use zewif::Blob;
/// # use zewif_zcashd::zcashd_wallet::{IncrementalMerkleTree, IncrementalWitness};
/// // Create a tree with a specific structure
/// let tree = IncrementalMerkleTree::new();
///
/// // Create a witness for a note at a specific position
/// let filled: Vec<Blob<32>> = Vec::new();
/// let cursor = None;
/// let witness = IncrementalWitness::<32, Blob<32>>::with_fields(tree, filled, cursor);
///
/// // In a real implementation, this witness would be updated as new notes are added to the tree
/// ```
